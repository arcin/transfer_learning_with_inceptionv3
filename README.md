# transfer_learning_with_inceptionv3
Use Keras InceptionV3 to train a model that detects pneumonia in xrays

According to [this paper](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5845910/) published in pubmed, an accuracy score of 73%,
with an AUC score of 0.615, was achieved by human diagnosis.

The layers and hypeparameters in selected for this model can produce an accuracy score between 70-75% and an AUC score of 0.68.

Model was trained using a *mid-2017* mbp with a *2.9 GHz Intel Core i7 processor*
